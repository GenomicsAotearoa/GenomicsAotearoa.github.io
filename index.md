## Projects with public repositories:

### Cancer genomics
 - [Genomic translational oncology](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/genomic-translational-oncology)
 - [Cell-free genomics](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/cell-free-genomics)

These projects relate to the development and deployment of data analysis pipelines for processing cancer genomics data. Available repositories:
 - [cancer-seq-pipeline](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/cancer-seq-pipeline): [bpipe](http://docs.bpipe.org/)-based pipeline for processing cancer genomics data in fastq format through to annotated variants in a simple report.
 - [bioinformatics-containers](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/bioinformatics-containers): [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers used by [cancer-seq-pipeline](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/cancer-seq-pipeline).
 - [dbNSFP_build](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/dbNSFP_build): [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container for script to download dbNSFP 'database' and wrangle it into a format suitable for pipeline annotation process.
 - [running_smcounter](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/running_smcounter): Notes on getting the smcounter pipeline/workflow up and running with singularity. Created as a regular repo, since organistations can't have gists

### Bioinformatics training
 - [Bioinformatics capability](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz/projects/bioinformatics-capability)

This project relates to the delivery of hands-on bioinformatics training workshops across New Zealand. Available repositories:
- [GenomicsAotearoa.github.io](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/GenomicsAotearoa.github.io) - the repository for this website.
